# Analyzing Members of Parliament Questioning Behavior
Final assignment for MY472-Data for Data Scientists

The following assignment answers two research questions:

- Is party affiliation a characteristic that discriminates between MP's that tend to ask questions about health and welfare vs economic issues?

- To what degree do variations in MPs' rates of posing questions about health and welfare versus economic issues mirror regional disparities in their constituencies' broader health and economic landscapes? 

The data folder has the .csv's and .shp files used in this analysis while the database folder contains a SQL database that was used to create the visualizations in the report.
